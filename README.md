## Introduction

In modern computing, optimizing performance is crucial, especially when working with large datasets. Multidimensional arrays are common in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. However, inefficient memory access patterns can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. 

This repository addresses these issues by allowing users to reorder the dimensions of ndarrays. The goal is to enhance cache usage and improve overall execution speed through loop interchange.

## Features

- **Reordering of Dimensions**: Easily change the order of ndarray dimensions.
- **Stride Adjustment**: Automatically adjust strides associated with the new order.
- **Cache-Oblivious Algorithms**: Utilize algorithms designed to minimize cache misses.
- **Tiling Support**: Implement tiling techniques to further optimize memory access.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of helper functions for efficient array manipulation.
- **JavaScript Compatibility**: Designed for use in Node.js and other JavaScript environments.

## Installation

To install the `ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order` package, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order
```

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/abdylla06/ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order/releases) section.

## Usage

Using the utility is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to reorder dimensions:

```javascript
const { reorderDimensions } = require('ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order');

// Example ndarray
const ndarray = /* your ndarray here */;

// Reorder dimensions
const newOrder = [1, 0, 2]; // New order of dimensions
const reorderedArray = reorderDimensions(ndarray, newOrder);
```

### Functionality Breakdown

1. **Reorder Dimensions**: The main function takes an ndarray and an array of new dimension orders.
2. **Stride Calculation**: The utility recalculates the strides based on the new order.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Optionally, you can log performance metrics to analyze improvements.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating the reordering of a 3D array:

```javascript
const { reorderDimensions } = require('ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order');

const ndarray = [
  [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
  [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
];

const newOrder = [2, 0, 1]; // New order of dimensions
const reorderedArray = reorderDimensions(ndarray, newOrder);
console.log(reorderedArray);
```

### Advanced Example with Tiling

In this example, we apply tiling to optimize memory access:

```javascript
const { reorderDimensions, applyTiling } = require('ndarray-base-loop-interchange-order');

const ndarray = /* your large ndarray here */;
const newOrder = [1, 0, 2]; // New order of dimensions

const reorderedArray = reorderDimensions(ndarray, newOrder);
const tiledArray = applyTiling(reorderedArray, tileSize);

console.log(tiledArray);
```
